## Texitor ~ A Simple Text Editor

# Overview
This project is a simple text editor built with a python library called Tkinter. The program's name is Texitor, and it provides many of the basic controls and key bindings you'd expect from a lightweight editor. I've made this program just to gain experience with Tkinter, no other motives. This project helped me learn about wedgits, event handling, and layout management.

# Other Questions
If you have any questions containing to the code, feel free to ask but there's a good chance I might never answer it since I'm barely ever on this site.
Also, I cannot verify that this program works on other systems but appears to work fine on Windows 10 (my system).
