## Texitor ~ A Simple Text Editor

# Overview
This project is a simple text editor built with a python library called Tkinter. The program's name is Texitor, and it provides many of the basic controls and key bindings you'd expect from a lightweight editor. I've made this program just to gain experience with Tkinter, no other motives. This project helped me learn about wedgits, event handling, and layout management.
